# SOP Retrieval System

## Overview
The SOP Retrieval System is a mock application built with Streamlit to simulate a simplified Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) retrieval system. Users can input questions related to SOPs, and the system responds with predefined answers based on the queries.

## Getting Started
1. **Install Streamlit:**
In your code editor type:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
In your terminal type:
   ```bash
   streamlit run mock_sop_app.py
   ```

5. **Usage:**
   - Access the application in your browser (default: http://localhost:8501).
   - Type questions in the input bar and click the "Search" button to receive predefined answers.

## Why It's Valuable
This mock SOP retrieval system provides a glimpse into the potential benefits of a streamlined SOP access system for the company. Key advantages include:
- **Time Efficiency:** Quick access to SOP information saves time for employees.
- **Reduced Errors:** Minimizes the likelihood of errors by providing accurate and consistent procedural information.
- **Compliance and Audits:** Aids in maintaining compliance with industry standards and regulations, supporting transparent record-keeping for audits.

This system serves as a proof of concept for a more advanced SOP retrieval system, demonstrating the value of efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility in handling procedural information within the company.
